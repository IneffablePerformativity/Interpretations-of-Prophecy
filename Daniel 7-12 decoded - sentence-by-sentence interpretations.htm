After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.

Trump. Four here matches four in some later verses. Perhaps some four US states that most supported him? Perhaps some four people that supported him? Perhaps some four people on his COVID team? Perhaps his four adult children? I'll have to study the old news.
Dominion (no pun intended) was given Trump as President in 2016.

Biden. Bumbling Old Joe is the very Antichrist, to whom it has been given to 'scatter the power of the holy people' (America).

Ten horns is a feature of the Dragon and Beast of Revelation.

The fiery stream is the exhaust of a running Honda Civic engine, perhaps like model 'D15B2 16V SOHC'.
Thousand thousand (10^3)^2 refers to a male angel (see the obvious male treble), while myriad myriad (10^4)^2 refers to a female angel (see the autoerotic math of 2 saying 2.)
Certainly, Daniel is open, and I can open much of Revelation too.

Forty years studying this stuff I conclude: there is good, and there is evil. It is polarizing, divisive. There are no innocents and no fence sitters because it is an active spiritual war border.

All we need here is an atheist, or policies against churches.
As a software engineer, I often refer to C# to solve time constructs. After some experimenting, I concluded for 3.5 TIMES you must take the same day of the month, while adding 42 months to whatever date.
By that rule, January 20, 2021 + 3.5 TIMES = July 20, 2021.
"TIMES" and not "YEARS" is because we have an incomparably difficult modern calendar that you could not begin to explain to an ancient. Years would be an untruth, an inaccuracy to tell them.

In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
</td>

</td>

<tr>
<td>
And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.

Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
</td>
<td>
This RAM stands for the USA political system (or perhaps specific parts of it, like: federal, executive; or perhaps the DEEP STATE, the SHADOW GOVERNMENT, aka "THE SWAMP").
The TWO HORNS of the ram represent the two predominant political parties: Republicans, and Democrats.
At the time of this Ram-Goat scene, before 2016, the USA President then was Obama, a Democrat. Therefore, the taller horn of the ram, which came up last, represents the Democrat party.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
</td>

I don't know for west, north, south, but Washington DC is east.
Everybody says you can't fight city hall; Nothing sure but Death and Taxes; Trump has opened our eyes to how none can deliver you out of the hand of America's Deep State / swamp. What was that quote? In January of 2017, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned Trump that Intel officials 'have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.'
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
</td>

Donald J. Trump *IS* that HE GOAT.
Touched not: Flying? Floating? Ascended? Annointed?
The notable horn between his eyes is the Republican party / system.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
</td>
<td>
Washington DC is in a vale, a depression on a river, the Potomic.
Here fury is Strongs 2534: Heat, Rage, ....
Trump demonstrated his fury in many ways.
I am reminded of the photo of Trump in a tuxedo, scowling down at Ms. Clinton. Trump chose a 'mean' photo for the cover of his book, 'Crippled America'. Trump castigated many people from both parties, also the deep state news media apparatus; And worst, he makes mean tweets!
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
</td>
<td>
As I said, I remember how harshly he castigated many people in both parties. Trump had to first beat other Republicans in the Primary, then beat Democrat Hillary and her supporters in 2016.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
</td>
<td>
The Republican party / system has become a complete disappointment exhibiting total Trump abandonment over the course of the last few years.
'Notable ones' might, but need not mean people. 
I suggest they might be four of the fifty states of the United States, including in them Indiana.
But also, it could be some four persons of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Coronavirus_Task_Force">White House Coronavirus Task Force</a> but they are not out of that horn so much.
Or it could be the four adult children of Trump, but they are not out of that horn so much.
Finally they might be some four Republican supporters, but OUT OF them must come Pence. Maybe he is one, with three other people.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.
</td>
<td>
Out of Indiana came its governor, Mike Pence. By being chosen as Trump's Vice President, Pence waxed exceeding great. Is not America 'the pleasant land'?
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.
</td>
<td>
Especially, as being put in charge of the COVID-19 crisis, Pence might have authorized some things hard on the American people. Or, something else. I have not really studied what Pence did for four years.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.
</td>
<td>
The prince, the ruler, of the host, the American people, is Trump.
This particular event refers to when Mike Pence ruled over the US Senate from January 6, 2021, to about 3 AM on January 7, 2021, to count/decide the Electoral Votes, and decided to choose the votes against Trump. More verses later will discuss this again.
Daily sacrifice is what would normally happen in the Jewish temple.
<a href = "https://bit.ly/3gs75Xs">Jonathan Cahn recently mentioned here,</a> a passage from the period of its establishment in its halls: "We have built no national temples but the Capitol."
When Pence chose the fraudulent electors, truth left the temple.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.
</td>
<td>
This is the transgression of the fraudulent election.
The host refers to all the fraudulent votes for Biden.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
</td>

The sanctuary and the host (citizens) are being trodden down now.
</td>

And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
</td>
<td>
2021-01-03 plus 2300 = 2027-04-22.
I do not know what is this future event.
Perhaps such cleansing will require extensive human labor, not a supernatural miracle, far longer than the other duration Daniel mentioned, 3.5 years, which is to the end of the reign of Biden.
</td>

And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.

And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.

Yeah, this is crunch time, decision time happening right now!

The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
</td>
<td>
Not literally! Both Media and Persia are kingdoms that anciently captured and ruled over Babylon. In the spiritual war I described above, Babylon is often used to symbolize the dark, evil side.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
</td>
<td>
Grecia, I think, never ruled over Babylon(?) and I recall reading that it may have an heritage that came from the Jews or Christians(?).
Anyway, it will be important to remember Greece later to comprehend the phrase 'ships of Chittim': Chittam is an island, now called Cyprus, in the Mediterranean Sea, and the Greeks sent troops into the Levant (the middle east) thereby.
As I said, the horn of he goat / Trump is that same Republican party that is also the first or earlier horn of the ram / swamp.
</td>

<tr>
<td>
Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
</td>
<td>
I ask you: What four stood up when it appears that the Republicans as a whole abandoned Trump? Perhaps you could find four specific stong Republicans? This phrase 'kingdoms...out of the nation' again sounds to me like some four of the 50 United States.
Or, the four standing up could be four principal persons upon Trump's 'CoronaVirus Task Force', which also includes Pence as its chairperson.

<td>
And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
</td>
<td>
I have two candidates for this role: PENCE, or FAUCI. Only Pence will fit in certain other places, and the acme of 'trangressors come to the full', was Pence ruling over the election count on Jan 7. But come to the full might better mean after installing Biden. So these few verses near here could be about another hideous topic, the COVID-19 PLANDEMIC. Dr. Fauci, having 'short man syndrome', might appear fierce. Strongs says that 'Dark Sentences' used here might mean intrigues, schemes. Again, either Pence or Fauci qualify.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.

Again, Pence or Fauci? Pence only had that one election moment, while Fauci has created and sustained an ongoing Franken-Virus and policy train wreck for America, and for the world.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
</td>
<td>
Per Strongs, craft means deceit. Fauci's Franken-Virus and the social policy manipulations thereafter, while peaceful, have certainly destroyed many.
I suspect Fauci, I read an atheist, is more likely to deny God (Jesus, Prince of princes) outright than Pence; This could mean policy banning Christian church meetings. Pence's role is over, Fauci's role is lingering in some long tail.

This verse is still long before the Jan 6-7 electors at the Senate under Pence, coming shortly...
On the face of a Biden landslide that the media was portraying, Biden was expecting the win, and the 'whole kingdom' refers to the globalists, progressives, and sundry others with evil adgendas, the height of Babylon.
'Upright ones' here probably acknowledges that personal salvation is not perfectly aligned with a person's political preferences.
This 'daughter of women' refers to Vice President Kamala Harris.
Searching for this rare hebraism, compare this web finding: The "daughters of music" (Ecclesiastes 12:4) are singing women.
Therefore, this hebraism probably means Harris is an activist for women's rights. Indeed, I found this: Kamala Harris declared "the status of women is the status of democracy" on Tuesday, in her first speech before the United Nations.
I don't have any prior opinion about Harris, but she joined the evil side, which has corrupted her. It's just like the Lord telling me to cease my egoistic task, 'or you will die', above.
